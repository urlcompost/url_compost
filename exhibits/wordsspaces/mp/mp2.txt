our father in heaven
(seated on ivory tower)
hallowed be thy name
(nameless are the dead)
thy kingdom come, thy will be done
(trampled underfoot)
on earth as in heaven
(o beautiful hell)

give us our daily bread
(leavened with malice)
forgive us our trespasses
(on stolen land)
as we forgive
(never)
those who trespass against us
(they take our land)
lead us not to temptation
(with raised fist)
but deliver us from evil
(no savior but us)
amen
