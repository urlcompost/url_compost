And the eyes were opened 
By the morning light
The sky was brightened
And peppered by flight
The faces of many 
Others subside
And from the ash worked through
The broken beak

Take from the mother
All on your own

It waited for years
For the world to come
The weight of the world
Bore his tongue
Leaving behind
The love, so strong
Never believing
The heart so strong

I can’t see it
It’s all true
