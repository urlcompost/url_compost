amidst the storm-frenzied banana tree tops

I looked out into the wet darkness
And the need to acknowledge myself
Bellowed, a pot-bellied toad
Helpless in the undergrowth.
I wish for the stars to line my
Eye. Sitting still my gut tries to
Grapple with the dark. Learn how
to climb without my arms. I am
Leaning into my foolishness.
The free pass of a child,
The slightest twinge of fool muscle
To take one step forward. Once
More into being. Another to
Choose to Be.
